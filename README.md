# Grapholizer-Data-Gathering-Tool
Grapholizer Data Gathering Tool
This tool was developed during the IP6 Grapholizer project. It is based on the Neo Smartpen Windows SDK sample application.
The Grapholizer data gathering tool is the first step of using the Grapholizer work flow.
It allows the user to establish a connection with the pen, create a new recording session and participants and export the gathered data as a .json file, which
can be opened in the Grapholizer analysis tool.

The Analysis tool can be found here: https://github.com/Jayrab95/Grapholizer-Data-Analysis-Tool
